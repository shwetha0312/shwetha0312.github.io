I am currently working as a Research Associate II at the *Multimodal Content Experiences Lab*  at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). In the last 2.5 years I've primarily worked with [Dr. Apoorv Saxena](https://research.adobe.com/person/apoorv-saxena/) and [Dr. Balaji Srinivasan](https://research.adobe.com/person/balaji-vasan-srinivasan/) on leveraging Large Language models (LLMs)/ Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for document experience projects for Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Express. I've worked a wide range of research areas: retrieval and attribution for document question answering, document stylization and transformation, graphic design generation and speculative decoding. I am currently interested and working on model merging techniques for LLMs/VLMs and using model internals for interpretibility. 

I completed my bachelorâ€™s thesis under the supervision of [Prof. N Venkateswaran](https://www.ssn.edu.in/staff-members/dr-n-venkateswaran/) at SSN College of Engineering. My project focused on the road object detection from radar sensor data using machine learning and deep learning object detection techniques. During my undergraduate studies, I also explored the estimation of tracer kinetic parameters from undersampled DCE-MRI data, under the supervision of [Dr. Phaneendra Yalavarthy](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/) at the [Medical Imaging Lab](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/yalavarthy/MIG/index.html), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

If you'd like to know more about my work or discuss potential collaborations, please check out my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g8cMt-ZXZrlr51qxeZnOraboziLpAcJF/view?usp=share_link). I'm always open to new opportunities and interesting conversations!
